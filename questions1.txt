How did you break up your project, and what are the security ramifications?
  We divided our project into 3 epics, each consisting of multile defined activites from the project description. With regard to mitigating security ramifications, we opted to create a new "development" branch for each epic, so to ensure our invidual coding efforts follow the same standards and implementations and do not cause any vulnerabilities before merging the finished tasks into master.

How did you choose to break down your epic into various issues (tasks)?
  Our 3 epics are each focused on a different aspect of the overall project: setup, functionality, and testing vulnerabilities.

How long did you assign each sprint to be?
  Each sprint will span 2 weeks and will be denoted by the due date assigned to each milestone.

Did you deviate from the AGILE methodology at all? If yes, what is your reasoning for this?
  While we chose not to make use of standard AGILE tools such as Scrum, the process behind our project planning is consistent with the AGILE methodology.
  On GitHub, we used our own AGILE implementation of defining epics under "GitHub Projects", user stories are under "GitHub Milestones", and sprints take the form of a collection of "GitHub Issues" with due dates.
  In doing this, we are able to assign "GitHub Issues" for each individual person.

How do you ensure that after each issue/milestone that security has been verified? How would you identify such issues in an ideal environment?
  One aspect of security verification is using GitHubs built in Security tools. // finish me
