What Web Application security mechanisms are involved in your topology? What security mechanisms would ideally be involved?
	The primary security mechanism in our topology is authentication and content access control management through PHP.
	However, it is also ideal to secure passwords for user accounts by encrypting passwords stored in the account database.
	It would also be ideal to add one or more caching servers along with a load balancer to help mitigate the possibility of denial of service.
	In a real world scenario, it would be imperative that we also obtain a TLS certificate and set up HTTPS to secure communications between the client and server.
	// I've got nothing else, but there might be more we could add here

What testing framework did you choose and why?
	// I don't know about this one. Gia implemented it
