1. How would you fix your code so that these issues were no longer present?
    Any input into the fields will not only need to be sanitized after being submitted, but will also need to be sanitized on output.
    Output should also be as least verbose as possible.

2. What are the limitations, if any that, of the SQL Injection issues youâ€™ve included?
    The SQL injections in this context will only affect the brickflix database, but not any other databases.
    This is because we have restricted the php DB user to only be allowed to modify the "brickflix" database.
    Otherwise, the possibilities are, for the most part, limitless.
