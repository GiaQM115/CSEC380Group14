1. How would you fix your code so that this issue is no longer present?
We would fix this issue by removing the users privilege to execute shell commands, as well as filter the users input to remove “;”. This would prevent any possibility of multi-command queries. We would also search for videos by using the database instead of the directory they’re stored in.
