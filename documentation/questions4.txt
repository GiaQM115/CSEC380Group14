1. How do you prevent XSS is this step when displaying the username of the user who uploaded the video?
We prevent XSS by using CSP to not allow and scripts to run in the page since we do not use any javascript for the website anyway.
2. How do you ensure that users can’t delete videos that aren’t their own?
We ensure that users can only delete their videos by only giving them the option to select videos they have uploaded in the delete manager. Then when we actually delete the video we check to make sure the correct user is deleting it.
