1. Link to test cases: // provide

2. To ensure that users cannot bypass authentication requirements, //finish

3. // what the fuck is session fixation?

5. To prevent password brute force, there is a login limit of 3 times before a user is locked out. // how long do we lock them out, or do we require a security question to be answered or something like that?

6. // username enumeration??

7. If the sessionID is predictable, a session could be easily stolen with something like a brute force attack. To prevent this, // how do we determine session IDs??
