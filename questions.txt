What is the URL of your GitHub project?
  https://github.com/GiaQM115/CSEC380Group14.git

How did you break up your project, and what are the security ramifications?
  We divided our project into 3 epics, each consisting of multile defined activites from the project description. With regard to mitigating security ramifications, we opted to create a new "development" branch for each epic, so to ensure our invidual coding efforts follow the same standards and implementations and do not cause any vulnerabilities before merging the finished tasks into master.

How did you choose to break down your epic into various issues (tasks)?
  Our 3 epics are each focused on a different aspect of the overall project: setup, functionality, and vulnerabilities. 

How long did you assign each sprint to be?
  2 weeks; sprints are denoted by due date assigned to each milestone. 

Did you deviate from the AGILE methodology at all? If yes, what is your reasoning for this?
  // I don't think we did but someone else gotta jump in here and help me out

How do you ensure that after each issue/milestone that security has been verified? How would you identify such issues in an ideal environment?
  One aspect of security verification is using GitHubs built in Security tools. // someone jump in and help me finish this thought
